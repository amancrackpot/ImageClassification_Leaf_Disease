# Disease Indentification on Cassava Leaf:
### In this our task is to classify each cassava plant image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With this, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

#### Categories
- Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
- Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
- Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
- Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
- "Healthy

#### The code needed to train the model is detailed in here https://github.com/amancrackpot/ImageClassification_Leaf_Disease/blob/master/cassava-tensorflow-resnet50.ipynb
I have used transfer learning by making use of pre-trained resnet50 and finetuning it
